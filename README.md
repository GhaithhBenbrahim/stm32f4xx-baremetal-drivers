## Introduction

This repository documents my learning journey in developing baremetal drivers for STM32F4 microcontrollers (specifically tested on STM32F407G-DISC1). The primary purpose is educational - to deeply understand microcontroller internals by working directly with hardware registers, rather than creating production-ready drivers.Currently implemented drivers include:

- **GPIO** (General Purpose Input/Output)
- **SPI** (Serial Peripheral Interface)
- **I2C** (Inter-Integrated Circuit)
- **USART** (Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)

**Note:** For most real-world applications, ST's HAL library remains the better choice as it's thoroughly tested and maintained. This project serves as a learning exercise in embedded systems fundamentals.

## Why Baremetal? (Learning Objectives)
- üéì Understand register-level microcontroller programming
- üîç Learn how HAL libraries abstract hardware operations
- üß© Master peripheral initialization and configuration
- ‚ö° Observe the direct performance impact of low-level coding
- üõ†Ô∏è Develop debugging skills for hardware-level issues

## Getting Started
For fellow learners:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GhaithhBenbrahim/stm32f4xx-baremetal-drivers.git
