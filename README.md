## Introduction

Welcome to my STM32F4xx baremetal drivers development journey! This repository documents my progress in creating low-level drivers from scratch for the STM32F4 microcontroller family without relying on HAL/LL libraries.

**Current Development Focus:**
- GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)
- SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
- I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)
- USART (Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)

## Why Baremetal?
- ðŸš€ Maximum performance with minimal overhead
- ï¿½ Full control over hardware registers
- ðŸ§  Deep understanding of microcontroller internals
- ðŸ“¦ No dependency on vendor libraries

## Project Status
ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§  
This repository is actively being developed. Drivers are being implemented and tested sequentially. Check back regularly for updates!

## Getting Started
While the drivers are under development, you can:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GhaithhBenbrahim/stm32f4xx-baremetal-drivers.git
